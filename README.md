# Challenge

There are three services that have various issues and need to be deployed via containers.

`hello-world-golang` - Golang REST endpoints

`hello-world-nodejs` - Nodejs REST endpoint

`hello-world-nginx` - Nginx reverse proxy

Review the DevOps Challenge below and README files in the specific application directories. The completed system will be the able to return HTTP responses via Nginx reverse proxy from a golang, and node application.

There are various other enhancements and issues present. You should be looking to fix and discuss any issues that may arise even after you have a working deployment.

## Evaluation

After submitting, you will be scheduled to go over the work with one of our engineers. They will be evaluating the work based on the following criteria:

- Infrastructure as code
- Issues identified in code
- Solutions implemented

As you review the files please note any issues, even if you will not have time to fix them.

## Time

Please spend a maximum of three (3) hours to complete the work you feel represents your devops skills. If you spend more than three (3) hours please record the time you spent and provide details. Part of the exercise is to see how you prioritize work and break work down into manageable chunks.

## DevOps Challanges

- Develop infrastructure as code that deploys all three services to a local environment
  - Build and deploy all applications in a single command
- Ensure nginx proxy is setup correctly to proxy both applications.
- Review applications for production readiness.
